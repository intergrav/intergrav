# 📰 About Me
Hello, my name is Devin! Most people may know me as UltraStorm or intergrav. I do programming, music, visual design, and animation sometimes. I am currently working on a badge library, 2 Minecraft modpacks, and learning a few programming languages. I am also working on my new album, A Light in the Sky.

# 📝 My Projects
If a project is marked with a red circle, that means I am no longer maintaining it. However, if it's marked with a green circle, I am currently working on it. 

Sadly I do not have too much free time, so I won't be able to work on much at a time. Feel free to fork any of these projects and keep on maintaining them - most of the stuff I work on is open source.
